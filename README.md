This README provides a comprehensive guide to effectively utilizing the library's features.

## Installation

To integrate the React Voice Visualizer library into your project, simply install it via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install react-voice-visualizer
```

or

```bash
yarn add react-voice-visualizer
```

## Version 2.x.x Release Notes

**Breaking Changes:**
- Ref Handling Update: In this version, the library has been enhanced to manage audio references (audioRef) internally. Users no longer need to pass ref={audioRef} separately to components. This change offers a more seamless and intuitive experience.

**New Features:**
- Preloaded Audio Blob Support: Version 2.x.x introduces the capability to set preloaded audio blobs. Users now have the flexibility to load audio blobs from various sources, such as user inputs or files using `setPreloadedAudioBlob` function, expanding the library's versatility in different scenarios.

## Usage

To start using the VoiceVisualizer component, you will need to import the necessary hook and component from the library.
Here's an example of how to use this library in your `App` component:

```typescript jsx
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { useVoiceVisualizer, VoiceVisualizer } from "react-voice-visualizer";

const App = () => {
    // Initialize the recorder controls using the hook
    const recorderControls = useVoiceVisualizer();
    const {
        // ... (Extracted controls and states, if necessary)
        recordedBlob,
        error,
    } = recorderControls;

    // Get the recorded audio blob
    useEffect(() => {
        if (!recordedBlob) return;

        console.log(recordedBlob);
    }, [recordedBlob]);

    // Get the error when it occurs
    useEffect(() => {
        if (!error) return;

        console.error(error);
    }, [error]);

    return (
        <VoiceVisualizer controls={recorderControls} />
    );
};

export default App;
```

## Getting started

1. Import the required components and hooks from the library.
2. Initialize the recorder controls using the `useVoiceVisualizer` hook.
3. Use the provided state and functions to manage audio recording and playback.
4. Render the `VoiceVisualizer` component to display the real-time audio visualization.
5. Use the provided buttons to start, pause, stop, and save the audio recording.

Remember to include necessary CSS styles to customize the components and buttons according to your design preferences.
